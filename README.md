## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Stacking multiple background images on top of each other, using pseudo elements to add a background element that can go out of the element.
- You can create a drop shadow on the background of a pseudoelement with filter(dropshadow). I did not expect this to be possible!
- Using label and checkbox for a no-JavaScript accordion.
- I also decided to stop being too strict on the exact sizing of objects as I was getting really tired trying to match typography and padding perfectly. I decided as long as it was functionally effective I would be fine with it.

### Continued development

I'm not sure what the best way to deal with height changes necessary to accommodate for opening up accordions should be dealt with, as I know it can shift the whole page down in a more complicated web page.
